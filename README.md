# Lets work hard, and play hard today!

So, story!
One day, two programmers decided to go on a hike. They took a tent, food, but forgot compasses and maps. After several hours of wandering through the forest, one says:

- Listen, we have to find a way home somehow!

The second programmer pulls out a laptop, opens a text editor and starts writing something.

- What are you doing?! - asks the first.

- I'm writing code. If it works, we will find a way. And if not...

- So what?

- Then at least we will know where the mistake is! ðŸ˜„
